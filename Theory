A data point which behaves differently from the rest of the data point.This can deviate our ML model.Treat them carefully,remove them,treat them.
Out liers can be dangerous and cannot be.

When is outlier dangerous?
=>if in a problem ,thedataset contains age as 300 then it is an outlier and we should remove it as it is not possible.
When useful?
=>If i want to make anomaly detection,then outliers are needed as they give us some information.

So,with outliers either we can remove them or we can add an additional column in our dataset so that that outlier might become the normal data point.

Effect of outlier:-
bad effect on Linear regression,logistic regression,adaboost,deep learning-common pattern-we calculate weights over here.
not much effect on tree based algos-bcz. they mainly cut our data space.

How to treat outliers?

How to detect outliers?
=>1)if the column is normally distributed-the range is (mean+-3*s.d.)
  2)skewed distribution-data is shifted left or right
